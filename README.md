# Top Ten Website by Madeline Gowan & Griffin Parker
This program is two different top ten lists put together. Madeline made a top ten list of her favorite pokemon, and Griffin made a top ten list of some of 
his favorite songs. It was designed to be viewed on a full sized computer screen. To begin, click on either the text 'Gameboy' or the actual Gameboy on the main screen 
to view Madeline's list. Click on the text 'MP3 Player' or the actual MP3 Player on the main screen to view Griffin's list. We hope you enjoy!

I enjoyed working on this program with Madeline. I think it looks good and runs well. My favortie parts of this program are the different sounds that are played on both
lists. I like the design of the program and the throwback aspect of it.
